            <h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
            <p>
              As it is the common practice with almost all professional websites
              this site also uses cookies, which are tiny files that are
              downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. This page
              describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we
              sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you
              can prevent these cookies from being stored. However, this may
              downgrade or ‘break’ certain elements of the site’s functionality.
              Our cookies are created when you (user) load our BX Technologies  website
              onto your browser. Our website sends information to the browser
              which then creates the file we talked about above. Every time you
              visit our website, your browser takes this file and sends it to
              our website server. These cookies are not only created by our
              website, but they are also created by the services that we are
              using, which includes widgets, ads (if there are any), plugins, or
              other elements on the website pages.
            </p>
            <h4>How We Use Cookies?</h4>
            <p>
              We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
              Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard
              options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the
              functionality and features they added to this site. It is
              recommended that you leave it on for all cookies if you are not
              sure whether you need them or not, in case they are used to
              provide a service that you use.
            </p>

            <h4>Disabling Cookies</h4>
            <p>

              settings on your browser. Be aware that disabling cookies will
              affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you
              visit. Disabling cookies will also result in disabling certain
              functionality and features of this site. Therefore it is
